# Web Scraper

1. Boxing sport doesn't have search feature. (Beacuse it wasn't possible to add it)
2. Check `search.py` to see the available search queries. 
example : Inorder to search "La liga" user can write any thing like
- laliga
- LA LIGA
- la liga
- La liga 
(Search queries are case insentive)

But not
- la-liga
(No special/whitespace character inbetween words except for single space " ")
